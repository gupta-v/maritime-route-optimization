## Abstract and Problem Statement

### Research Motivation

Maritime transportation is the backbone of global trade, handling approximately 90% of international cargo. Traditional routing systems rely on static algorithms that fail to leverage the vast amounts of dynamic data now available from Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and oceanographic forecasts. These systems typically optimize for simple metrics like shortest distance, ignoring complex environmental factors that significantly impact vessel safety, fuel consumption, and operational efficiency.

### Core Problem

The challenge lies in developing an intelligent routing system that can:

1. **Learn from Human Expertise**: Extract navigational knowledge from historical vessel trajectories recorded in AIS data
2. **Adapt to Environmental Conditions**: Incorporate dynamic weather patterns, ocean currents, and wave conditions into routing decisions
3. **Balance Multiple Objectives**: Optimize for safety, efficiency, and operational constraints simultaneously
4. **Handle Complex Dependencies**: Model spatial relationships and neighborhood effects in maritime navigation

### Our Approach

We propose a novel two-stage learning pipeline:

**Stage 1 - Imitation Learning**: A Graph Neural Network (GNNImitator) learns to replicate human navigation patterns from historical AIS trajectories, capturing implicit navigational knowledge and safety practices.

**Stage 2 - Reinforcement Learning**: A second GNN (GNN_QNetwork) is fine-tuned using reinforcement learning in a custom maritime environment to optimize routing policies beyond human performance while maintaining safety constraints.

### Key Innovation

The system models the ocean as a navigable graph where nodes represent discrete maritime locations with associated environmental features, and edges represent possible vessel movements. This graph-based representation enables the application of Graph Neural Networks to capture complex spatial relationships and dependencies that influence routing decisions.

## Research Contributions

### Technical Contributions

1. **Novel Two-Stage Learning Framework**: We introduce a systematic approach that combines imitation learning with reinforcement learning, providing stable initialization while enabling policy optimization beyond human demonstrations.

2. **Graph-Based Maritime Environment**: Our custom OpenAI Gym-compatible environment (`VesselNavigationEnv`) models maritime navigation as a graph traversal problem with weather-dependent rewards and constraints.

3. **Weather-Aware Node Features**: Integration of real-time oceanographic data (wave height, wave period, ocean currents) as node-level features, enabling weather-responsive routing decisions.

4. **Scalable Graph Construction**: Automated sea graph generation using geospatial data, excluding landmasses and creating navigable network topologies suitable for machine learning applications.

### Methodological Contributions

1. **AIS Data Processing Pipeline**: Comprehensive data cleaning and trajectory extraction methodology for processing large-scale maritime tracking data with temporal consistency validation.

2. **Multi-Objective Reward Function**: Sophisticated reward mechanism balancing progress incentives with safety penalties, incorporating domain knowledge about maritime hazards.

3. **Transfer Learning Architecture**: Strategic weight transfer between imitation and reinforcement learning models, preserving learned navigational patterns while enabling policy improvement.

### Research Scope and Domain

**Current Focus**: Weather-aware routing in the Guam maritime region (13°-14°N, 144°-145°E) using static weather snapshots and historical AIS data from MarineCadastre.gov.

**Future Extensions**: The architecture supports expansion to dynamic weather forecasting, fuel optimization, vessel-specific constraints, multi-vessel coordination, and global maritime networks.

## Technical Overview

### Problem Formulation

We formulate maritime routing as a sequential decision-making problem on a graph:

- **State Space**: Current position on the maritime graph with associated environmental features
- **Action Space**: Movement to adjacent nodes (up to 8 directional neighbors)
- **Reward Function**: Composite metric balancing progress toward destination with safety considerations
- **Environment Dynamics**: Weather-influenced transition costs and safety penalties

### Learning Paradigm

The system employs a curriculum learning approach:

1. **Supervised Learning Phase**: Learn basic navigation patterns from human demonstrations
2. **Reinforcement Learning Phase**: Optimize beyond human performance through environmental interaction
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Compare generated routes against historical trajectories and optimal baselines

### Graph Representation

Maritime space is discretized into a regular grid (0.05° resolution ≈ 5.5km spacing) where:

- **Nodes**: Represent navigable positions with weather and geographic features
- **Edges**: Connect adjacent nodes, representing feasible vessel movements
- **Features**: Each node contains [latitude, longitude, wave_height, wave_period, current_velocity]

## Methodology

### Sea Graph Construction

#### Geospatial Processing

The graph construction process transforms continuous oceanic space into a discrete, navigable network:

```python
# Core graph building process
def create_sea_graph(shapefile_path, lat_min, lat_max, lon_min, lon_max, step):
    # Load landmass data from Natural Earth shapefiles
    land = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)
    land_union = land.geometry.union_all()

    # Generate regular grid of candidate points
    grid_points = [(lat, lon) for lat in np.arange(lat_min, lat_max + step, step)
                              for lon in np.arange(lon_min, lon_max + step, step)]

    # Filter out land-intersecting points
    sea_points = [pt for pt in grid_points if not land_union.contains(Point(pt[1], pt[0]))]

    # Create graph with 8-directional connectivity
    G = nx.Graph()
    for lat, lon in sea_points:
        G.add_node((lat, lon))
        # Connect to valid neighbors in 8 directions
        for dlat, dlon in [(-step,0), (step,0), (0,-step), (0,step),
                          (-step,-step), (-step,step), (step,-step), (step,step)]:
            neighbor = (lat + dlat, lon + dlon)
            if neighbor in sea_points:
                G.add_edge((lat, lon), neighbor)
```

#### Technical Considerations

- **Spatial Resolution**: 0.05° grid provides balance between computational efficiency and route precision
- **Connectivity Model**: 8-directional movement allows diagonal traversals, improving route flexibility
- **Landmass Exclusion**: Shapely geometric operations ensure no routes cross land boundaries
- **Graph Validation**: Connected component analysis ensures navigable paths exist between regions

### AIS Data Processing

#### Data Sources and Characteristics

The system processes daily AIS CSV files containing vessel tracking information:

- **Source**: MarineCadastre.gov (US Coast Guard data)
- **Coverage**: Global vessel positions with sub-minute temporal resolution
- **Key Fields**: MMSI, LAT, LON, BaseDateTime, VesselName, SOG, COG
- **Volume**: Millions of position reports per day requiring efficient processing

#### Data Cleaning Pipeline

```python
def clean_and_filter_ais(raw_folder_path, output_path, lat_min, lat_max, lon_min, lon_max):
    # Process large CSV files in chunks to manage memory
    chunk_size = 100_000

    for file in csv_files:
        for chunk in pd.read_csv(file, chunksize=chunk_size):
            # Remove invalid position reports
            chunk.dropna(subset=["LAT", "LON", "BaseDateTime", "MMSI"], inplace=True)

            # Parse and validate timestamps
            chunk["BaseDateTime"] = pd.to_datetime(chunk["BaseDateTime"], errors="coerce")
            chunk.dropna(subset=["BaseDateTime"], inplace=True)

            # Geographic filtering to study region
            chunk_filtered = chunk[
                (chunk["LAT"] >= lat_min) & (chunk["LAT"] <= lat_max) &
                (chunk["LON"] >= lon_min) & (chunk["LON"] <= lon_max)
            ]
```

#### Trajectory Extraction

The system converts raw position reports into coherent vessel trajectories:

1. **Temporal Ordering**: Sort positions by timestamp within each vessel (MMSI)
2. **Gap Detection**: Identify trajectory breaks using time threshold (6+ hours)
3. **Trajectory Splitting**: Create separate trajectories across temporal gaps
4. **Length Filtering**: Retain only trajectories with sufficient length (10+ waypoints)
5. **Grid Snapping**: Map continuous positions to discrete graph nodes

### Weather Integration

#### Data Sources

Weather features are obtained from the Open-Meteo Marine API, providing:

- **Wave Height**: Significant wave height in meters
- **Wave Period**: Dominant wave period in seconds
- **Ocean Current Velocity**: Surface current speed in m/s
- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly forecasts with historical data availability
- **Spatial Coverage**: Global ocean coverage with interpolation

#### Feature Engineering

```python
def create_node_features(graph, weather_data):
    feature_list = []
    for node in graph.nodes():
        lat, lon = node
        weather = weather_data.get(node, default_values)

        # Construct feature vector: [lat, lon, wave_height, wave_period, current_velocity]
        features = [lat, lon, weather['wave_height'],
                   weather['wave_period'], weather['ocean_current_velocity']]
        feature_list.append(features)

    # Standardize features for neural network training
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    node_features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(feature_list)
    return torch.tensor(node_features_scaled, dtype=torch.float)
```

#### Current Limitations and Extensions

**Current State**: Static weather snapshots provide a single environmental condition per node for the entire episode.

**Planned Extensions**:

- Time-series weather forecasts as dynamic node features
- Seasonal and historical weather pattern integration
- Uncertainty quantification in weather predictions
- Multi-model ensemble forecasting

### Imitation Learning Phase

#### Architectural Design

The GNNImitator employs a Graph Convolutional Network to learn next-node prediction from historical trajectories:

```python
class GNNImitator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_dim, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(in_channels, hidden_dim)
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, out_channels)

    def forward(self, x, current_node_idx, edge_index):
        # Process node features through GCN layers
        x = F.relu(self.input_layer(x))
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x, edge_index))

        # Extract embedding for current position
        current_node_embedding = x[current_node_idx]
        return self.output_layer(current_node_embedding)
```

#### Training Methodology

**Task Formulation**: Multi-class classification where the model predicts the next node given the current position and graph context.

**Loss Function**: Cross-entropy loss over all possible next nodes, weighted by trajectory frequency to handle class imbalance.

**Data Preparation**:

- Create (current_node, next_node) pairs from trajectories
- Implement temporal sequence handling with configurable sequence length
- Apply data augmentation through trajectory sub-sampling

**Training Process**:

- Batch size: 128 sequences
- Learning rate: 1e-4 with Adam optimizer
- Epochs: 50 with early stopping on validation loss
- Regularization: Dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting

#### Evaluation Metrics

- **Next-Node Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly predicted next waypoints
- **Trajectory Completion**: Ability to generate complete paths to destination
- **Route Similarity**: Fréchet distance comparison with ground truth trajectories
- **Generalization**: Performance on unseen vessel types and routes

### Reinforcement Learning Phase

#### Environment Design

The `VesselNavigationEnv` implements the OpenAI Gym interface for maritime navigation:

```python
class VesselNavigationEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, graph, trajectories, weather_data, max_steps):
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(8)  # 8-directional movement
        self.observation_space = spaces.Discrete(len(graph.nodes))

    def step(self, action):
        # Get valid neighbors from current position
        neighbors = list(self.graph.neighbors(self.current_node))

        if action < len(neighbors):
            next_node = neighbors[action]
            reward = self._calculate_reward(next_node)
        else:
            reward = -2  # Invalid action penalty

        # Check termination conditions
        done = (next_node == self.target) or (self.current_step >= self.max_steps)
        return self.node_to_index[next_node], reward, done, {}
```

#### Reward Function Design

The reward function balances multiple objectives through carefully tuned components:

**Progress Reward**: Encourages movement toward destination

```python
distance_before = calculate_distance(current_node, target)
distance_after = calculate_distance(next_node, target)
progress = distance_before - distance_after
progress_reward = progress * scaling_factor
```

**Weather Penalties**: Discourage navigation through hazardous conditions

```python
wave_penalty = -(wave_height ** 2)  # Quadratic penalty for high waves
current_penalty = -(current_velocity * 2)  # Linear penalty for strong currents
period_penalty = -max(0, 8 - wave_period) * 0.5  # Penalty for choppy seas
```

**Behavioral Constraints**:

- **Step Penalty**: -0.2 per timestep to encourage efficient routes
- **Revisit Penalty**: -5 for returning to previously visited nodes
- **Timeout Penalty**: -100 for exceeding maximum episode length
- **Terminal Reward**: +500 for successfully reaching destination

#### Deep Q-Learning Implementation

**Network Architecture**: The GNN_QNetwork processes graph structure and outputs Q-values for each possible action:

```python
class GNN_QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, hidden_dim, num_actions):
        super().__init__()
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(in_channels, hidden_dim)
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_actions)

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = F.relu(self.input_layer(x))
        h = F.relu(self.conv1(x, edge_index))
        h = F.relu(self.conv2(h, edge_index))
        return self.fc(h)  # Q-values for all nodes
```

**Training Algorithm**:

- **Experience Replay**: Buffer capacity of 20,000 transitions
- **Target Network**: Updated every 20 episodes for stability
- **Exploration Strategy**: Epsilon-greedy with decay from 0.9 to 0.05
- **Batch Size**: 128 transitions sampled from replay buffer
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-5 with gradient clipping

**Weight Transfer**: Initialize RL network with pre-trained imitation learning weights to accelerate convergence and maintain learned navigation patterns.

### Memory Optimization

Large-scale data processing requires careful memory management:

**Chunked Processing**: AIS files are processed in configurable chunks to handle datasets exceeding available RAM.

**Lazy Loading**: Weather data is cached locally to avoid repeated API calls and reduce network dependency.

**Graph Serialization**: NetworkX graphs are pickled for fast loading across training sessions.

**Feature Preprocessing**: Node features are standardized and converted to PyTorch tensors once, then reused across training phases.

### Parallel Processing

The system leverages parallel processing where appropriate:

**Graph Construction**: Land intersection tests are parallelized using joblib for faster sea node identification.

**Weather Fetching**: API requests are batched and cached to optimize external data retrieval.

**Training**: PyTorch automatically utilizes available GPUs for neural network operations.

### Error Handling and Validation

**Data Validation**: Input data is validated for completeness, format consistency, and geographic bounds.

**Model Checkpointing**: Training progress is saved periodically to enable recovery from interruptions.

**Graceful Degradation**: System provides default values when external APIs are unavailable.

**Path Validation**: Generated routes are checked for feasibility and graph connectivity.

## Experimental Setup

### Study Region Selection

**Geographic Focus**: Guam maritime region (13°-14°N, 144°-145°E) chosen for:

## Results and Analysis

### Training Performance Analysis

### Imitation Learning Results

The supervised pre-training phase demonstrated strong convergence characteristics:

- **Initial Loss**: 2.1883 (Epoch 1)
- **Final Loss**: 0.1199 (Epoch 50)
- **Convergence Pattern**: Rapid initial improvement (2.19 → 0.65 in 3 epochs), then steady refinement
- **Training Stability**: Smooth convergence without significant oscillations, indicating appropriate learning rate selection

![Result 5](output/route_comparison_plot4.png)  
![Result 6](output/route_comparison_plot5.png)

Based on the generated visualizations, several key patterns emerge:

#### Path Efficiency Comparison

**Observed Route Characteristics**:

- **Historical AIS Routes**: Variable lengths (52-1,341 steps), showing diverse real-world navigation strategies
- **AI Models**: Consistently hitting maximum episode length (1,001 steps), indicating conservative/exploratory behavior
- **Route Diversity**: Each approach shows distinct path selection, with varying degrees of directness

#### Navigation Behavior Patterns

**Historical Routes (Red Dashed)**:

- Show pragmatic, often direct paths
- Demonstrate human operators' preference for efficiency
- Variable complexity based on specific journey requirements

**Imitation Learning (Blue Dotted)**:

- Attempts to replicate human patterns but with some inefficiencies
- Shows learned spatial relationships from training data
- 1,001-step limitation suggests incomplete trajectory optimization

**Reinforcement Learning (Green Solid)**:

- Displays more systematic exploration patterns
- Often takes circuitous routes, indicating over-conservative safety behavior
- Consistent maximum-length episodes suggest reward function may penalize direct routes too heavily

## Research Insights and Discussion

### Key Findings

**Two-Stage Learning Validation**: The pipeline successfully demonstrates knowledge transfer from imitation to reinforcement learning. The RL agent's consistent behavior (though conservative) indicates that pre-trained weights provided stable initialization.

**Weather Integration Impact**: While quantitative weather avoidance metrics require additional analysis, the systematic route patterns suggest the models are responding to environmental features rather than purely geometric considerations.

**Reward Function Analysis**: The consistent maximum-episode behavior (1,001 steps) across AI models indicates the current reward structure may over-penalize direct routes. This suggests:

- Step penalty (-0.2 per timestep) may be too small relative to other penalties
- Weather penalties might be too aggressive, causing excessive avoidance behavior
- Terminal reward (+500) insufficient to encourage direct path-finding

### Performance Limitations Identified

**Route Efficiency**: Both AI approaches generate significantly longer routes than historical data, indicating:

- Possible over-fitting to safety considerations
- Insufficient reward for progress toward destination
- Need for multi-objective optimization balance

**Training Convergence**: RL rewards plateaued around -2,000, suggesting:

- Local optima in policy space
- Possible need for curriculum learning approaches
- Alternative exploration strategies (e.g., curiosity-driven exploration)

### Algorithmic Insights

**Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance**: The epsilon-greedy strategy successfully reduced exploration over time, but final performance suggests the learned policy may be sub-optimal for route efficiency.

**Graph Neural Network Benefits**: The consistent spatial patterns in generated routes demonstrate that GNNs successfully capture neighborhood relationships in maritime navigation.

**Transfer Learning Success**: The smooth transition from pre-training (loss: 2.19 → 0.12) to RL fine-tuning (rewards: -3,500 → -2,000) indicates effective knowledge transfer.

## Limitations and Challenges

### Observed System Limitations

**Route Optimality**: Current AI models generate routes 1.5-2x longer than historical trajectories, indicating:

- Over-conservative safety behavior
- Insufficient progress incentivization
- Need for reward function rebalancing

**Episode Termination**: Consistent maximum-episode-length termination suggests:

- Poor convergence to destination
- Possible environment design issues
- Need for adaptive episode length based on distance

**Weather Response**: While weather integration is implemented, quantitative analysis of weather avoidance behavior requires additional metrics development.

### Training Efficiency Concerns

**Computational Cost**: 4+ hours for 3,000 episodes indicates scalability challenges for:

- Larger geographic regions
- More complex weather models
- Real-time operational deployment

**Sample Efficiency**: The gradual improvement curve suggests need for:

- More sophisticated exploration strategies
- Hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches
- Better reward shaping techniques

## Future Research Directions

### Immediate Technical Improvements

**Reward Function Redesign**:

- Increase progress rewards relative to safety penalties
- Implement dynamic reward scaling based on journey phase
- Add explicit distance-to-target incentives

**Training Efficiency Enhancements**:

- Implement curiosity-driven exploration
- Develop hierarchical route planning (strategic + tactical)
- Investigate policy gradient methods (PPO, A3C) for better convergence

**Evaluation Methodology**:

- Develop comprehensive safety vs. efficiency metrics
- Quantify weather avoidance behavior
- Implement statistical significance testing across multiple random seeds

### Research Questions for Investigation

1. **Optimal Reward Balance**: What reward function parameters achieve human-level route efficiency while maintaining safety improvements?

2. **Weather Response Validation**: How can we quantitatively measure and validate weather-aware routing behavior?

3. **Scalability Analysis**: How does performance degrade with larger geographic regions and more complex environmental conditions?

4. **Real-World Validation**: How do simulation results translate to actual maritime operational conditions?

## Experimental Validation Recommendations

### Additional Metrics Development

**Safety Metrics**:

- Weather exposure scores (wave height, current strength)
- Route deviation in hazardous conditions
- Comparative safety analysis vs. historical routes

**Efficiency Metrics**:

- Route directness ratio (actual distance / optimal distance)
- Time-to-destination estimates
- Fuel consumption modeling integration

**Learning Metrics**:

- Convergence analysis across multiple training runs
- Generalization testing on unseen route pairs
- Transfer learning effectiveness quantification

### Statistical Validation Requirements

- **Multiple Random Seeds**: Train and evaluate across 5-10 different random initializations
- **Cross-Validation**: Test on held-out trajectories from different time periods
- **Ablation Studies**: Systematic component removal to validate architectural choices
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Implementation of additional routing algorithms (A\*, genetic algorithms)

This analysis reveals that while the technical infrastructure is sound, the current reward function and training configuration require refinement to achieve practical maritime routing performance. The consistent behavior patterns indicate successful learning, but optimization objectives need rebalancing for operational effectiveness.

### Advanced Algorithmic Development

**Policy Gradient Methods**: Explore Actor-Critic algorithms (PPO, A3C) that may provide better stability and sample efficiency than Q-learning in continuous action spaces.

**Graph Attention Networks**: Replace GCN layers with attention mechanisms to better model varying importance of neighborhood nodes in navigation decisions.

**Meta-Learning Approaches**: Develop models that quickly adapt to new vessel types, regions, or operational constraints with minimal additional training.

**Transfer Learning**: Enable trained models to transfer knowledge across different geographic regions and vessel characteristics.

### Operational Integration Research

**Vessel-Specific Modeling**: Incorporate vessel length, beam, draft, engine characteristics, and cargo type as features affecting weather response and routing constraints.

**Fuel Consumption Optimization**: Integrate physics-based or data-driven fuel consumption models to optimize operational costs directly.

**Port Integration**: Model port schedules, berth availability, pilot requirements, and harbor traffic in routing decisions.

**Regulatory Compliance**: Incorporate Traffic Separation Schemes, Emission Control Areas, and other maritime regulations as hard constraints.

### System Integration and Deployment

```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Hyperparameter Tuning

Edit `src/config.py` to customize system behavior:

```python

GRID_STEP = 0.03  # Higher resolution (slower, more precise)
GRID_STEP = 0.08  # Lower resolution (faster, less precise)

# Training intensity
PRETRAIN_EPOCHS = 100    # More imitation learning
RL_EPISODES = 5000       # Extended reinforcement learning
IL_LEARNING_RATE = 5e-5  # Slower, more stable learning
RL_LEARNING_RATE = 1e-4  # Faster RL convergence

# Environment difficulty
MAX_STEPS_PER_EPISODE = 500   # Shorter episode limit
MAX_STEPS_PER_EPISODE = 2000  # Longer planning horizon
```

#### Custom Study Regions

Modify geographic bounds for different maritime areas:

```python
# Mediterranean Sea example
LAT_MIN, LAT_MAX = 30.0, 46.0
LON_MIN, LON_MAX = -6.0, 36.0

# North Sea example
LAT_MIN, LAT_MAX = 50.0, 62.0
LON_MIN, LON_MAX = -4.0, 12.0

# Adjust shapefile accordingly
LAND_SHAPEFILE = "data/shapefile/your_region/land.shp"
```

#### Performance Optimization

**GPU Configuration**:

```python
# Force CPU usage (for debugging)
DEVICE = torch.device("cpu")

# Specific GPU selection
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda:0")  # Use first GPU
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda:1")  # Use second GPU
```

**Memory Management**:

```python
# Reduce batch sizes for limited memory
IL_BATCH_SIZE = 64
RL_BATCH_SIZE = 64
REPLAY_BUFFER_CAPACITY = 10000

# Increase for high-memory systems
IL_BATCH_SIZE = 256
RL_BATCH_SIZE = 256
REPLAY_BUFFER_CAPACITY = 50000
```
